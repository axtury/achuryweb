            <h3>Integrating mobile technology with real-time information on traffic conditions in Nairobi </h3>
          </div>
          <p>Nairobi is a city with limited roads and public transportation infrastructure. In turn, all of Nairobiâ€™s transportation systems, from Matatus (public buses) to bicycles and private cars, are characterized by low levels of efficiency, transparency in their rates and a lack of information on the traffic conditions. </p>

          <p>Ma3Route is a mobile, web and SMS platform based in Nairobi which collects data on mobility through its users (crowdsourcing). However, currently this platform has information available only in text format (tweets).</p>

          <p>The project developed an interactive map function and a database system that integrate into the existing Ma3Route platforms. This new feature geo-locates real-time tweets of various users, sorts them, and places them on a base map. In addition, this map allows data storage on the network for experts and academics in mobility and urban planning to have information available to develop analysis on traffic trends in Nairobi. This new feature allows users to get instant information on what is happening with the mobility around them. </p>
