            <h3>What Happens When Resettlements Focus on the Physical Environment: The Aftermath of Resettlement Process in Displaced Communities in Cartagena </h3>
          </div>
          <p>Over three million people were affected in the country by the rainy season associated with "La Niña" phenomenon between April 2010 and June 2011(Alta Consejería para las Regiones y la Participación Ciudadana 2012). Likewise, Colombia has the second most internally displaced persons in the world: 6.3 million  (trailing only Syria with 7.6 millions victims, and followed by Iraq with 3.3 million) (IDMC 2015b). Given the magnitude of displacement in the country, this problem contributes the largest number of human rights violations in the country (HRW 2005).  </p>

          <p>This research studies the dilemmas that accompany resettlement processes, the involuntary physical and social isolation of residents from access to services and public facilities, the consequences of this for economic well-being and quality of life, and the improvement of the personal security from crime and violence.

          <p> This research will answer the following question: Why do resettlement processes create deteriorated socioeconomic livelihoods and fragmented communities? This thesis finds that while resettlement processes provide new built environments to address the physical needs of the displaced population, they do not address the needs that perpetuate poverty, vulnerability, and marginalization. The research explores the challenges and dilemmas that those communities face in order to inform discussions related to the physical, economic, and social reconstruction of communities in the aftermath of displacement. It also analyses the parallels and contrasts between 28 displaced families that went through the government program of resettlement process and 10 families that decided to reconstruct their lives outside that program. The goal is to re-exanimate the policy, the specific approach of the state, the gains and losses of this resettlement process, and highlight the relationship between Colombia’s armed conflict and resettlement processes. Thus, this thesis will identify potential recommendations for other displaced communities and for policymakers and NGOs examining how housing is necessary, but not sufficient to resettle sustainable and resilient communities.</p>
