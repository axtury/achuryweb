            <h3>Decision making methodology for investment in medical infrastructure</h3>
          </div>
          <p>The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) is the largest government institution in Latin America and the most important in Mexico with more than 54 million users throughout the country. This institution has the obligation to attend to all persons and their families who have a formal job and are affiliated to the IMSS. </p>

          <p>The IMSS health system is divided into 3 levels. First level which refers to the Units of Family Care (UMF) where they are mainly served by ambulatory services. Users are assigned the closest UMF based on where each user resides (Postal Code). The second level is made up of hospitals that focus on providing actions and services for specialized outpatient care, hospitalization and emergency care. Users are referred directly from the FMUs. The third level is where the diseases of greater complexity, which need specialized equipment and facilities, are treated. Users are referred from the second level network. </p>

        </div> 
          <p>Currently the decision making for the expansion and construction of new medical infrastructure does not consider areas where there is no IMSS medical infrastructure or reliable indicators of how the medical units are operating. Currently, the IMSS does not take into account the analyzes that it makes and is based on what each department indicates as a priority. </p>

        <p>The project developed a methodology that starts from a statistical analysis that encompasses a more comprehensive vision of the problem of deficit and quality in medical infrastructure. At the same time, the indicators that were created with the use of geospatial analysis were combined in which the socio-economic variables, the geography of the place and the urban conditions of each region can be integrated, in order to produce a listing where Prioritize in a methodical way the real needs of each region in health matters. </p>
