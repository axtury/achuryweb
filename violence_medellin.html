            <h3>Do Integral Urban Projects (IUP) reduce levels of crime in low income areas in Medellin? </h3>
          </div>
          <p>Analyzing the forces that shape the dynamics of violence within the city of Medellin is important in order to understand the complexity of the conflict along the history of the city and its social and physical segregation. The exclusion of these communities from society reduces the opportunities to improve their precarious conditions. This vacuum of authority and lack of opportunities is the perfect scenario for different organizations to legitimize their power and replace the State in its role of control and supplier of services such as education, health and housing. The escalation of conflict between the state and violent groups to take control of these communities perpetuates the cycle of violence. This situation generates large externalities that over time communities have to coexist within it.</p>

          <p>In 2004, the local government began the construction of the Integral Urban Projects (IUP) in northeastern Medellín which included Boroughs One and Two. The IUP strategy was to intervene public spaces, educational institutions, there were in precarious conditions. The objective was, that as a result of these interventions, a process of physical and social regeneration would begin.</p>

        </div> 
          <p>This project was seeking to learn if the IUPs were an effective approach to reduce violence indicators in conflictive areas. Based on data from the Medellin National Police, the project generated a map showing where and how the rates of violence varied before, during and after the Integral Urban Projects in the Boroughs One and Two in comparison with the borough three were no IUP were developed. The reason for choosing communes 1, 2 and 3 for the analysis was that these communes had similar characteristics in population, socio-economic levels and deterioration of the public space. Boroughs One and Two have IUP, while Borough three did not have any intervention which served as a control group to contrast the data. </p>

        <p>From the physical perspective, there is no doubt about the benefits derived from the construction of the UIPs in Boroughs One and Two, however this project couldn’t stablish a correlation between the appearance of the UIP and the reduction of violence base on the violence indicators data. The intention of this project is to show how data could be implemented to analyze the impact of public policies in the urban context to refute or reaffirm urban concepts or policies. </p>
